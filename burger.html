                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                   <h4>Making the Burger Patties:</h4>
                   <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
                   <li>Divide the mixture into equal-sized portions and shape them into patties, ensuring they are slightly larger in diameter than the burger buns to allow for shrinkage during cooking.</li>
                   <li>Using your thumb, make a slight indentation in the center of each patty. This prevents the patties from bulging in the middle while cooking.</li>
                   <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                   <li>Once the pan is hot, add the burger patties and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness (for medium-rare, cook for about 3-4 minutes per side).</li>
                   <li>If adding cheese, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking and allow it to melt.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <h4>Assembling the Burgers:</h4>
                    <li>Slice the burger buns in half horizontally and lightly toast them on a grill pan or in a toaster.</li>
                    <li>Spread your preferred condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
                    <li>Place a lettuce leaf on top of the condiments, followed by a tomato slice and onion slices.</li>
                    <li>Place the cooked burger patty on top of the vegetables.</li>
                    <li>Add any optional toppings such as bacon, avocado, fried egg, jalape√±os, or mushrooms, if desired.</li>
                    <li>Place the top half of the burger bun over the filling to complete the burger.</li>
                </ol>
