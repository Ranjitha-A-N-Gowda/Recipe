                <ol>
                    <h4>Making the Noodle Dough:</h4>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
                    <li>Crack the eggs into the well in the flour mixture.</li>
                    <li>Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs into the flour until a crumbly dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands in the bowl until it forms a smooth and elastic dough. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, a teaspoon at a time, until the dough reaches the desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to roll out.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <h4>Rolling and Cutting the Noodles:</h4>
                    <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into smaller portions for easier handling.</li>
                    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough into a thin sheet using a rolling pin. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3-4 mm).</li>
                    <li>Once the dough is rolled out, use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into thin strips to make noodles. You can cut them as wide or narrow as you prefer.</li>
                    <li>As you cut the noodles, lightly dust them with flour to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining portions of dough until all the noodles are formed.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <h4>Cooking the Noodles:</h4>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.</li>
                    <li>Once the water is boiling, carefully add the fresh noodles to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Cook the noodles for about 2-3 minutes, or until they are tender but still have a slight bite to them. Fresh noodles cook much quicker than dried noodles, so keep an eye on them to avoid overcooking.</li>
                    <li>Once the noodles are cooked to your liking, use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer them to a colander to drain.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the cooked noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent them from sticking together.</li>
                    <li>Serve the freshly cooked noodles immediately with your favorite sauce, stir-fry, or soup.</li>
                </ol>
