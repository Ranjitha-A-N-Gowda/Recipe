                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Prepare the Marinade: </b><p>In a bowl, mix thick yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, tandoori masala or paneer tikka masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt to taste. Adjust the spices according to your preference.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Marinate the Paneer and Vegetables: </b><p>Add paneer cubes to the marinade and coat them well. Allow the paneer to marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.
                        If using vegetables, coat them with the marinade separately and let them marinate for the same duration.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Skewer the Paneer and Vegetables: </b><p>Thread the marinated paneer cubes and vegetables onto skewers, alternating between paneer and vegetables.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Grill the Paneer Tikka: </b><p>Preheat the grill or oven to medium-high heat.
                        Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking.
                        Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the paneer and vegetables are lightly charred and cooked through.
                        Alternatively, you can also cook the paneer tikka in a preheated oven at 200°C (400°F) for about 15-20 minutes or until done.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Serve Hot: </b><p>Once cooked, remove the paneer tikka skewers from the grill or oven.
                        Serve hot with mint chutney, sliced onions, lemon wedges, and a sprinkle of chaat masala for extra flavor.</p></li>
